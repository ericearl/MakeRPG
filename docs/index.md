# The System

MakeRPG is intended to be a system that allows anyone who can edit plain text YAML files to make automatic characters and game systems.

You can find the rules for creating the two necessary YAML files on the left pane of this website.

# YAML Files

"YAML Ain't Markup Language" (YAML) files have a few basic formatting rules.

1. Every character within the file is treated as a character, so quotatons and punctutation are not necessary, but they are allowed.
1. "Octothorpes" or "pound signs" or "hashtags" `#` are always ignored by programs that are reading or parsing YAML files.
1. "Keys" or "Keywords" are always the first thing followed by a colon and a space `: ` and then a "Value".
1. You can either have:
    - Single values
    - Indented and hyphenated/bulleted lists of values ; or
    - Indented and further expanded keys and values
1. Indents are made up of 2 or 4 spaces and must be consistent throughout.
