# Creating a Fifth Edition Shadowrunner

This guide advises on how to use MakeRPG to choose your base character and customize them to the book's rules.  Print out a character sheet and get to creating!

## Step One: Choose Concept

Shadowrun doesn't squeeze you into a role or class based system box, but instead offers up almost everything to almost everyone.  There are some common character types/concepts to which you can specialize conceptually, listed below with their essential stats:

- Face (Charisma and Willpower)
- Spellcaster (Magic, Charisma, Intuition, Willpower)
- Decker (Logic, Intuition, and Willpower)
- Technomancer (Resoance, Logic, Intuition, and Willpower)
- Rigger (Reaction)
- Street Samurai (Body, Strength, and Agility)

MakeRPG chooses a history from the priority table, stats, skills, and some qualities.  These are mostly free of character concept, so that is up to you to customize.

## Step Two: Choose Metatype

MakeRPG calls this the "History", which is really just selecting priorities automatically from the Priority Table.

Note: There's something wrong with the metatype racial bonuses in MakeRPG right now, so make sure to enter your own from page 66.

## Step Three: (If You) Choose Magic or Resonance

There are characters with or without Magic or Resonance in MakeRPG.  Look at page 69 if you go with Magic though (Adept, Magician, Aspected Magician, or Mystic Adept).  There's also a short explanation of Technomancers (users of Resonance skills) on page 69.  Basic Magic and Resonance skills are listed on page 90.

## Step Four: Purchase Qualities

MakeRPG chooses a small amount of positive or negative qualities which decrease or increase your Karma points, respectively.  You can choose more or swap around as you like, but the more you choose, the more difficult it may become to roleplay or use your character's skills.

## Step Five: Purchase Skills

There are "skill groups" and "skills" (and you can further specialize skills if you like).  Points taken in a skill group apply to a few skills at once.  See page 90 for a fleshed out list.

MakeRPG does not purchase any knowledge or language skills, so make sure to distribute skill points from what you have if you want some knowledge or language skills.

Note: MakeRPG skill levels have already added in bonuses from Skill Groups, so be careful with redistributing skill points from skills you got from a skill group.

## Step Six: Spend Your Resources

MakeRPG provides a shop to purchase gear and other material items (including augmentations) with your Nuyen.  Some items have multiple ratings or levels or grades that effect the cost or availability of the items.  Make sure to read the Product Descriptions of items for those levels.

And three caveats:

1. Augmentations are only allowed to raise your Attributes by 4 (per attribute) max.
1. You can only get items with an Availability of 12 and a device rating of 6 max at character creation.
1. All gear is subject to gamemaster approval.

Commonly needed/used gear (from page 94):

- Weapons
- Ammunition
- Clothing and Armor
- Cyberware/bioware
- Commlink
- Fake SINs and fake licenses
- Cyberdeck
- Programs
- Tools
- Breaking and entering tools
- Surveillance equipment
- Lifestyle
- Vehicles
- Drones
- Biotech
- Disguises
- Sensors and sensory enhancement
- Magical goods
- Certified credsticks
- DocWagon contract

## Step Seven: Spending Your Leftover Karma

This is all up to you with your remaining Karma points.  Things you can/should buy, as applicable:

- Bound Spirits
- Complex Forms
- Spells
- Bond Foci
- Contacts
- Registering Sprites

## Step Eight: Final Calculations

See page 101 to fill out your character sheet.

## Step Nine: Final Touches

Write or think up some notes on your character's backstory and motivations and get GM approval of the whole character/sheet.

## Last Thoughts

Character creation is just that, a creative process.  MakeRPG only gets you started.  Get creative, make up something you can roleplay, and most of all have fun!
