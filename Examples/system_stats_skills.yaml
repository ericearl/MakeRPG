# "YAML Ain't Markup Language" (YAML) files have a few basic formatting rules.
#     1. Every character within the file is treated as a character, so quotatons
#        and punctutation are not necessary, but they are allowed.
#     2. "Octothorpes" or "pound signs" or "hashtags" (#) are always ignored by
#        programs that are reading/parsing YAML files.
#     3. "Keys" or "Keywords" are always the first thing followed by a colon (:)
#        followed by a space ( ) and then a "Value".
#     4. You can either have:
#            a) Single values.
#            b) Indented and hyphenated/bulleted lists of values.
#            c) Indented and further expanded keys and values.
#     5. Indents are made up of 2 or 4 spaces and must be consistent throughout,
#        I prefer 4 spaces for easier readability.
#
# In this example Stats and Skills YAML for use with the MakeRPG system's
# CharacterCreator application, I will demonstrate the rules to follow to build
# a valid stats and skills system specifically for this software.
#
# There are more comments throughout, so please read from top to bottom

### vvv IMPORTANT vvv ###
# A "roles" key and a "stats" key are required for CharacterCreator
### ^^^ IMPORTANT ^^^ ###

# The "roles" indented keywork list is made of roles or what some systems call
# classes or types.  Each role listed after the roles key is the name of that
# role and each role has two necessary keywords, "special" and "common".  The
# special keyword list is a list of skills that only that role has available.
# The common keyword bulleted list is skills pulled from the broader pool of
# skills.  The role distributes "role" skill points among these.  Any other
# skills require a separate set of "other" skill points.
roles:
    Warrior: # this is the role
        special: # here's that special keyword
            Hit hard: 1-8 # this special skill and has a min of 1 and max of 8
        common: # common skills list from the larger pool below in "stats"
            - Buffness
            - Melee
            - Hand-to-hand
    Mage:
        special:
            Magic: 1-4
        common:
            - Read
            - Look cool
            - Be scary
    Rogue:
        special:
            Move fast: 1-6
        common:
            - Talk fast
            - Tell bad jokes
            - Pointy things

# Here we have the "stats" keyword.  Indented under that are the names as you
# want them of the character stats of the system you're defining.  Under each
# stat are the keywords "stat" and "skills".  "stat" is simply the minimum to
# maximum range of possible values of that stat.  "skills" is an indented list
# of keys and values where the key is the skill name and the value is the
# minimum to maximum range of possible values of that skill.

### vvv IMPORTANT vvv ###
# A minimum value greater than 0 means that minimum number of points will always
# be spent on that stat or skill from the stat or skill points.
### ^^^ IMPORTANT ^^^ ###

# This example only has two stats, "THINK" abd "DO"
stats:
    THINK:
        stat: 1-18 # all of the ranges can go between any minimum and maximum
        skills:
            Read: 0-4
            Look cool: 0-6
            Be scary: 0-4
            Talk fast: 0-10
            Tell bad jokes: 0-8
    DO:
        stat: 1-8
        skills:
            Buffness: 0-10
            Melee: 0-10
            Hand-to-hand: 0-10
            Pointy things: 0-10
