# "YAML Ain't Markup Language" (YAML) files have a few basic formatting rules.
#     1. Every character within the file is treated as a character, so quotatons
#        and punctutation are not necessary, but they are allowed.
#     2. "Octothorpes" or "pound signs" or "hashtags" (#) are always ignored by
#        programs that are reading/parsing YAML files.
#     3. "Keys" or "Keywords" are always the first thing followed by a colon (:)
#        followed by a space ( ) and then a "Value".
#     4. You can either have:
#            a) Single values.
#            b) Indented and hyphenated/bulleted lists of values.
#            c) Indented and further expanded keys and values.
#     5. Indents are made up of 2 or 4 spaces and must be consistent throughout,
#        I prefer 4 spaces for easier readability.
#
# In this example History YAML for use with the MakeRPG system's
# CharacterCreator application, I will demonstrate the rules to follow to build
# a valid history rolling system specifically for this software.
#
# There are more comments throughout, so please read from top to bottom

### vvv IMPORTANT vvv ###
# A "START" key: value and an "NPC" key: - list are required for
# CharacterCreator where values are all "history event names", a.k.a. "events"
### ^^^ IMPORTANT ^^^ ###

# The START key's value MUST match a history event name below
START: Personal Style # here's a basic key: value usage
# empty lines are okay throughout between keys and values, but not necessary

# The NPC key's hyphenated list MUST match a history event name below for each
# bulleted point
NPC:
    - Personal Style
    - What do you think of people?

# A "history event" is a single event which you would roll to choose in
# character creation during a regular game.  The order that history events
# appear does not matter as long as every named event has a matching definition.
# History events MUST have at least a "dice" and a "roll" key.
#
# The dice definition can be any dice definition of
# the form <QUANTITY>d<SIDES> <OPTIONAL + or -> <OPTIONAL OFFSET>, where
# <QUANTITY> MUST be an integer/whole number value of dice to throw, <SIDES>
# MUST be an integer/whole number greater than 1 representing the number of
# sides or possibilities of the dice, <OPTIONAL + or -> is an optional addition
# or subtraction to be used with <OPTIONAL OFFSET> which MUST also be an
# integer/whole number.  Examples:
#     a) 1d2
#     b) 5d17
#     c) 1d8 + 4
#     d) 3d6 - 2
#
# The roll key's values must themselves be key: values where all the possible
# dice rolls are represented in the keys.  For example, the following history
# event is a 1d10 dice event, meaning all values between 1 and 10 must have some
# sort of "outcome" value.  In this case the outcomes are a character's
# preferred personal style.
Personal Style: # keys can have multiple words and even punctutation
    dice: 1d10 # see the dice rule above
    roll:
        1: Leather # one word or multiple words are fine
        2: Pant-suits # hyphenated words are fine
        3: Suit & tie # special characters and symbols are fine excluding #
        4: EXERCISE wear # a mix of upper-case and lower-case is fine
        5: No real pants. Never real pants. # punctutation and spaces are fine
        6: Trendy/fashionable
        7: Militaristic, official or casual
        8: Street clothes
        9: Nudist
        10: always Mismatched
    next: What do you think of people? # the "next" key indicates what's next
What do you think of people?: # even punctuation is allowed in event names
    dice: 1d6 # not all dice need to be the same
    roll:
        1-3: Love 'em # you can use hyphens like this to represent a roll span
        4-6: Hate 'em # remember to cover all possible rolls
    next: Age

# This example shows the special "re-roll" capability with the "<ROLL X>" tag.
# For every <ROLL X> tag there has to be a reroll key down the line
Age:
    dice: 1d6 + 16
    roll:
        17: # the roll numbers have to correspond to the dice roll totals
            next: Life # note how no tag means no re-roll, or just 1 roll
        18:
            next: <ROLL X2> Life # roll two times total
        19:
            next: <ROLL X3> Life # roll three times
        20:
            next: <ROLL X4> Life # you get the idea...
        21:
            next: <ROLL X5> Life
        22:
            next: <ROLL X6> Life
    next: Siblings # you can have a next key after the re-rolls if you like

# This example shows how you can mix next keys with outcomes in rolls.
# Pay special attention to the reroll at the end.
Life:
    dice: 1d10
    roll:
        1-3:
            next: The good and bad
        4-6:
            next: Friends or enemies?
        7-8:
            next: Romance!
        9-10: Nothing eventful
    reroll: Life # "reroll" is really "return to the last <ROLL X> tag"

# In this example we will define a few rolls which lead to a reroll as well as
# demonstrate the EVEN and ODD roll keywords and the "<NPC type>" tag.  Each
# <NPC type> tag triggers an NPC history events list roll through the NPC: -list
# defined above and their character name is prepended with the NPC type info.
#
# Here we have 7 possible <NPC sibling> rolls and 3 possible only child rolls.
Siblings:
    dice: 1d10
    roll:
        1:
            next: <NPC sibling> Sibling binary gender
        2:
            next: <ROLL X2> <NPC sibling> Sibling binary gender
        3:
            next: <ROLL X3> <NPC sibling> Sibling binary gender
        4:
            next: <ROLL X4> <NPC sibling> Sibling binary gender
        5:
            next: <ROLL X5> <NPC sibling> Sibling binary gender
        6:
            next: <ROLL X6> <NPC sibling> Sibling binary gender
        7:
            next: <ROLL X7> <NPC sibling> Sibling binary gender
        8-10: Only child
    next: Love affairs # when all the re-rolls are over, next is "Love affairs"

# Here, regardless of the dice, an odd roll of the dice means a "female" outcome
# and an even roll means a "male" outcome.
Sibling binary gender:
    dice: 1d12
    roll:
        ODD: Female
        EVEN: Male
    next: Sibling relative age
Sibling relative age:
    dice: 1d10
    roll:
        1-5: Older
        6-9: Younger
        10: Twin
    reroll: Sibling binary gender

# And lastly, you can combine all these things as necessary.  This Example
# triggers four possible different NPC types and two of those are simple
# outcomes while two of them link off to two more history events (not defined in
# this file).  Since this has no top-level next keyword, the history ends here!
Love affairs:
    dice: 1d10
    roll:
        1-4: <NPC happy love> Happiness
        5:
            next: <NPC tragic love> Tragedy
        6-7:
            next: <NPC problematic love> Problems
        8-10: <NPC date> Dating
